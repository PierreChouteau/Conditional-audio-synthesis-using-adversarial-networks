# Conditional-audio-synthesis-using-adversarial-networks

## Abstract

In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have yielded impressive results on various
generative tasks. In particular, conditional GANs have gained increasing interest in user-guided generation, yet tend to suffer from mode collapse, resulting in low sample diversity. In this project, we will study how GANs can be used for class-conditional audio synthesis, and how to increase the diversity of the generated sounds. Specifically, the ultimate goal is to obtain a model capable of generating audio based on the desired genre. To do so, we will need to find a proper classification for "genres" and think about how to accurately condition our model. Hence, this project tackles several challenges: the training of a model on a variety of dataset and the conditioning of this model in order to produce a diversity of audio within a genre.
